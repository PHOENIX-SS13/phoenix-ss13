## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

On **2021-01-04** we have changed the way to compile the codebase.

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.

**[How to compile in VSCode and other build options](tools/build/README.md).**
